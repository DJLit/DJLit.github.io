# DJ Lit's documentation of everything tech!
## For teams after 2019-20

Hello! If you're looking at this, it's because you wish to understand how we've built the various services and websites in DJ Lit. In college, I bet my ass that no other committee/ club documents as much as I'm going. Before I start, this documentation is going to be really long. However, feel free to jump to the sections that you require anytime.

### Services

In the committee, we provite the following tech services:

1. DJVU ([djvu.in](https://www.djvu.in))

DJVU is the blogging platform of the committee. Every editorial member has an account, and the tech head has an account. Tech team can be given accounts if need be. I will explain the entire website in a later section.

2. Email (write@djvu.in)

If any outsider wishes to contribute their article to the blog, they can do so by sending an email to this email address. However, this is only a redirector! It's not an actual inbox. More on this in a specific section.
